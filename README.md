This is a attempt do create a [PostgREST](https://github.com/PostgREST/postgrest) version in c#.
This is not a version to compete with PostgREST and is not a translation from haskell to c#. 

It is a total new implementation just keeping the idea of PostgREST because I don't
know anything about haskell language, but I want to make a similar version.

This is an aspnet core app that runs with a posgres database server and receive rest calls with any json and 
insert, update or delete in the specified table in a more relaxed and lightweight way than the Microsoft Entity Framework.

You only need to create the table in the database, and you are ready to go.

Needless to say that this is a hobby project and is not production ready. 
This is a work in progress.
